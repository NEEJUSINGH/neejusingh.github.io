      A personal exploration of the mind through some modern and ancient concepts and lived experience.

    <p><strong>Mindfulness, Mindlessness, Mind your business……</strong></p>

    <p>If you speak English, you've probably heard this word a lot. Mind this and mind that.<br>
    But what exactly is this <strong>Mind</strong>?<br>
    Can we see it? Can we touch it? Or can we feel it at least?<br>
    If not, then what is it? Is it inside the brain? In the heart? Or somewhere outside the body?</p>

    <p>It’s clearly not a material object because if it were, it would be sitting on a table in some big lab, under a microscope.</p>

    <p>But before we delve deeper into this mystery of mind, let’s take a quick look at its etymology.<br>
    The word ‘mind’ comes from the Old English “gemynd”, which originally meant memory or the ability to remember.</p>

    <p>Over time, the concept of "mind" has evolved. In the modern world, it's often treated as something like a mental object, an invisible system or container responsible for various internal functions such as memory, understanding, emotions, decision-making, and more.</p>

    <p>Growing up in the Indian subcontinent, I was somewhat familiar with a few words that point toward what we might call the “inner world.” But even now, I find them hard to fully define. They seem to carry layers of meaning, depending on who’s using them, in what context, and why.</p>

    <p>Here are a few Sanskrit or Sanskrit-derived terms often used in everyday speech, poetry, and classical texts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manas (मनस्):</strong><br>
      Often described as the part of us that receives and reacts to sensory input like sound, light, heat, taste. It’s the one that “notices” what’s happening and has an initial response.</li>

      <li><strong>Buddhi (बुद्धि):</strong><br>
      This refers to discernment or decision-making. Someone who makes wise choices is often called ‘buddhimaan’. It is not just intelligence, but the clarity to know what feels right or true.</li>

      <li><strong>Chitta (चित्त):</strong><br>
      This one feels the hardest to explain. It’s often used to express an emotional tone or mood like when someone says in Nepali, <em>mero chitta dukhyo</em> (my chitta is hurt). It refers to a kind of feeling-awareness, sometimes described as “heart-space.”</li>

      <li><strong>Ahamkāra (अहंकार):</strong><br>
      This is the part that says “I.” The sense of self that owns thoughts, feelings, and actions. In English it is often translated as “ego,” but it is not just arrogance — it is the structure through which we refer to ourselves.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Together, these words do not form a single “thing” but rather a composite experience — like four lenses or layers through which inner life happens.</p>

    <h2>My Personal Reflection</h2>

    <p>It's interesting how I only started getting curious about the “mind” when I realized something was off with mine. My attention span was a joke. I was zoning out every four seconds — not even exaggerating.</p>

    <p>Brain chemistry? Environmental stuff? Behavioral patterns?</p>

    <p>It probably started in high school. I began having trouble following instructions in class. I suspect that consistent daydreaming led to a pattern of unconscious zoning out. Maybe I was bored. Maybe I was unhappy. Maybe my core needs were unmet, and I built a world where they were.</p>

    <p>That fantasy world slowly became dominant.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to college — I found out that many students struggle with attention. There is even a term for it: “Attention Deficit Disorder.” For some people, medication helps.</p>

    <p>But for me, it was not just about focus. I had 35 thoughts per minute, all in different directions. It was like having every browser tab open, all playing music. Life felt overwhelming. Disorganized.</p>

    <p>Time blindness. Memory glitches. No sense of how long things take. No real planning. Like being dropped into life without the manual.</p>

    <p>In 2023, I discovered a Buddhist meditation practice called <strong>Shamata</strong> — meaning "calm abiding." It is about focusing on a single object for a period of time, starting with 5–10 minutes and slowly building up. If the mind wanders, you gently bring it back without judgment. Over time, this improves focus and clarity.</p>

    <p>Since 2023, I have meditated fairly regularly. My focus has improved. I believe that with continued effort, I will get better at staying present. Though it fluctuates, it is no longer a crisis.</p>

    <p>These days, I am learning to sit still — not just physically, but mentally. I am still easily distracted. I still escape into daydreams. But I also return a little more each time.</p>

    <p>And in that returning, I think, the mind starts to feel less like a storm and more like a calm water.</p>

    <p>This is just the beginning of my exploration. I do not know where it will lead, but I am glad I started. I do not have all the answers yet — maybe I never will. But I am learning to stay, to feel, to witness.</p>

    <p><strong>And maybe that’s where the mind begins to unfold.</strong></p>

    <hr/>

    <h3>So… what really <em>is</em> mind?</h3>

    <p>Is it a mirror?<br>
    A web of thoughts?<br>
    A whispering cloud?</p>

    <p>If any part of this resonated with you, I would love to hear your reflections.<br>
    What is <em>your</em> relationship with the mind?<br>
    Do you have practices that help you stay present or centered?</p>

    <p>Let this be a space for gentle unfolding, together.<br>
    Thank you for reading :)</p>
